## What is this? 🤔

This is a server that lets your LLMs (like Claude , VSCODE ) talk directly to your Azure Cosmos DB data! Think of it as a friendly translator that sits between your AI assistant and your database, making sure they can chat securely and efficiently.

### Quick Example

```text
You: "What were our top 10 customers last month?"
Claude: *queries your Azure Cosmos DB database and gives you the answer in plain English*
```

## How Does It Work? 🛠️

This server leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a versatile framework that acts as a universal translator between AI models and databases. Although MCP is built to support any AI model, it is currently accessible as a developer preview in Claude Desktop.

Here's all you need to do:

1. Set up project (see below)
2. Add your project details to Claude Desktop's config file
3. Start chatting with your Azure Cosmos DB data naturally!

### What Can It Do? 📊

- Run Azure Cosmos DB queries by just asking questions in plain English

## Quick Start 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14 or higher
- Azure Cosmos DB NOSQL account or Azure Cosmos DB Emulator with the sample dataset(./dataset/vehciles) inserted
- Claude Desktop

### Set up project

Obtain the Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL account URI and KEY from the Keys section, and the Database ID and Container ID from the Data Explorer section, then create a `.env` file with the following keys, replacing the placeholder values with your own:

```env
COSMOSDB_URI=
COSMOSDB_KEY=
COSMOS_DATABASE_ID=
COSMOS_CONTAINER_ID=
```

### Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command in the root folder to install all necessary dependencies:  

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the Project**  
   Compile the project by running:  

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Start the Server**  
   Navigate to the `dist` folder and start the server:  

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Confirmation Message**  
   You should see the following message:  

   ```text
   Azure Cosmos DB Server running on stdio
   ```

### How to run it using VSCODE Insiders

To use the Azure MCP with VS Code Insiders with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, follow these instructions:

1. Install [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).

1. Install the pre-release versions of the GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat extensions in VS Code Insiders.

1. Open a new instance of VS Code Insiders in an empty folder.
1. Copy the [`mcp.json`](./.vscode/mcp.json) file from this repo to your new folder, and update the values to match your environment.

1. Open GitHub Copilot and switch to Agent mode. You should see Azure Cosmos DB MCP Server in the list of tools.

1. Try a prompt that tells the agent to use the Azure MCP server, such as "List Vehicles".

1. The agent should be able to use the Azure Cosmos DB MCP server to complete your query.

This setup allows you to seamlessly interact with Azure Cosmos DB through the MCP server in VSCODE with Github Copilot as shown below.

### Add your project details to Claude Destkop's config file

Open Claude Desktop and Navigate to File -> Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config and open the `claude_desktop_config` file and replace with the values below,

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cosmosdb": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [ "C:/Cosmos/azure-cosmos-mcp/dist/index.js" ] // Your Path for the Azure Cosmos DB MCP server file,
      "env": {
        "COSMOSDB_URI": "Your Cosmos DB Account URI",
        "COSMOSDB_KEY": "Your Cosmos DB KEY",
        "COSMOS_DATABASE_ID": "Your Database ID",
        "COSMOS_CONTAINER_ID": "Vehicles"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

You should now have successfully configured the MCP server for Azure Cosmos DB with Claude Desktop. This setup allows you to seamlessly interact with Azure Cosmos DB through the MCP server as shown below.
